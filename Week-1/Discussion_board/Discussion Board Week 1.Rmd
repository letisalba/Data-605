### Linear Algebra

$~$

#### Exercise C10

#### In Example TMP the first table lists the cost (per kilogram) to manufacture each of the three varieties of trail mix (bulk, standard, fancy). For example, it costs $3.69 to make one kilogram of the bult variety. Re-compute each of these three costs and notice that the computations are linear in character.

### Code

$~$

```{r}
# Matrix of (kg/batch) Trail Mix
trails <- matrix(c(7, 6, 2, 6, 4, 5, 2, 5, 8), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
trails
```

$~$

```{r}
# Find Batches (trails divided by 15)
trails_batch <- trails/15
trails_batch
```

$~$

```{r}
# Cost of Trail Mix
trails_cost <- matrix(c(3.69, 3.86, 4.45), nrow = 3, ncol = 1)
trails_cost
```

$~$

```{r}
# Solve to check for linearity
results <- solve(trails_batch, trails_cost)
results
```

### Conclusion

$~$

#### Since the values do not change within the matrix and there's no other computations being done, if these results were to be plotted then there would be straight lines.
