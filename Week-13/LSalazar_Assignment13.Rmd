### Univariate & Multivariate Calculus

#### 1. Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below.

$\int4e^{-7x}dx$

$~$

#### 2. Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is changing at a rate of $\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{3150}{t^4}$ bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where *t* is the number of days since treatment began. Find a function N(t) to estimate the level of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.

$~$

#### 3. Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the line is f(x) = 2x - 9

#### 4. Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.

$y = x^2 - 2x - 2$, $y = x + 2$

#### Enter your answer below

#### 5. A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year. It costs $3.75 to store one flat iron for one year. There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order. Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.

$~$

#### 6. Use integration by parts to solve the integral below

$\int ln(9x) * x^6 dx$

$~$


#### 7. Determine whether f ( x ) is a probability density function on the interval $[1, e^6]$. If not, determine the value of the definite integral.

$f(x) = \frac{1}{6x}$
