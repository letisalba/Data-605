### Probability Chapter 2 Exercise 14

Choose independently two numbers B and C at random from the interval [-1, 1] with uniform distribution, and consider the quadratic equation 

<center>
$x^2$ + Bx + C = 0
</center>

Find the probability that the roots of this equation

(a) are both real
(b) are both positive

<center> Hints: (a) requires $0 \leq  B^2 - 4C$, (b) requires $0 \leq B^2 - 4C$, $B \leq 0, 0 \leq C$.</center>


#### Solution

(a) for both are real


$B^2 - 4C \leq 0$
$B^2 \leq 4C$


Replace: B by y and C by X

$y^2 \leq 4x (-1 to 1)$

limits is [-1, 1]

$y \leq 2\sqrt{x}$ for x (0, 1)(0, 1)


Area under graph

= $\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1} 2\sqrt{x}\; dx$

= $\frac{1}{2}[\frac{4}{3}x^\frac{3}{2}]_{0}^{1}$

= $\frac{2}{3}$


(b) for both are positive

$B \geq 0 , C \geq 0$

As graph is symmetrical, wvt x axis 

Answer will be the half of the previous solution

Therefore: 

$\frac{1}{2} * \frac{2}{3}$

= $\frac{1}{3}$
