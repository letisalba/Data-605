### Chapter 6 Question 2: 

#### A card is drawn at random from a deck of playing cards. If it is red, the player wins 1 dollar; if it is black, the player loses 2 dollars. Find the expected value of the game.

```{r}
# Probability of Red
P_Red <- 26 / 52

#Probability of Black
P_Black <- 26 / 52

# Winning Amount $
Win <- 1

# Losing Amount $
Lose <- 2

# Expected  Value
ev <-( (P_Red * Win) - (P_Black * Lose) )
ev

# Variance
var <- (0^2 *(P_Red)) + (1^2 * (P_Black) - (-0.5^2))
var
```
