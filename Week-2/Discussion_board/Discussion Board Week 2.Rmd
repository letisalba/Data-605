### Handwritten:

### Using R:

```{r}
# Create the matrices

W <- matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0 , 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0), nrow = 4, ncol = 4)

b <- matrix(c(2, 1, 2, 1), nrow = 4, ncol = 1)
```

$~$

```{r}
# Bind the matrices together to create an argumented matrix
data <- cbind(W, b)
data
```

$~$

```{r}
# Using reduced row echelon form using Gauss-Jordan elimination
rref(data)
```

$~$

### Conclusion:
#### Solving it by hand I wasn't able to get very far and still confused about what to do next. I was able to find an R library called pracma was able to solve the problem. Based on this, b is not a subspace of W.
