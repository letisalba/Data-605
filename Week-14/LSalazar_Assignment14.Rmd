### Taylor Series Approximations

#### This week, we'll work out some Taylor Series expansions of popular functions

#### * $f(x) = \frac{1}{(1 - x)}$
#### * $f(x) = e^x$
#### * $f(x) = ln(1 + x)$

#### For each function, only consider its valid ranges as indicated in the notes when you are computing the Taylor Series expansion.
